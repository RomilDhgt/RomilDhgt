## ✨ About Me

😀 I am Software Engineer with a focus on Machine Learning and Full Stack Development. I believe in the transformative power of innovation, and I seek to cultivate my innovative spirit for the purpose of advancing sustainable energy. I am building my arsenal of skills in Machine Learning from my humble beginnings in applying linear regression models on a small Olympic medals dataset to creating Neural Networks to create new music. I have also developed my full stack skills to mastery, examplfied by my Capstone project where I partnered with Tesla to create a web application (Tech Stack: Next, TypeScript and MongoDB) solution to increase efficiency.
